# Quantum Goldchain (QTC) - Replit Guide

## Overview

Quantum Goldchain (QTC) is a post-Bitcoin era blockchain implementation written in Rust. It's designed as a 100% decentralized cryptocurrency with no governance, founders' control, pre-mine, or dev tax. The project implements a complete blockchain ecosystem including mining, wallet functionality, P2P networking, and APIs.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Core Blockchain Architecture
- **Language**: Rust 1.70+ for performance, memory safety, and concurrency
- **Consensus**: Proof-of-Work using RandomX algorithm (ASIC-resistant, CPU-friendly)
- **Transaction Model**: UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) system similar to Bitcoin
- **Storage Engine**: RocksDB for high-performance blockchain data persistence
- **Networking**: Custom P2P protocol for decentralized peer discovery and sync

### Mining System
- **Algorithm**: RandomX - designed to be ASIC-resistant and favor CPU mining
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Dynamic recalculation every 10 blocks for network stability
- **Block Timing**: Target of 7.5 minutes per block
- **Reward System**: Initial 27.1 QTC with halving every 5 years (262,800 blocks)

### Economic Model
- **Maximum Supply**: 19,999,999 QTC (fixed cap)
- **Coinbase Maturity**: 100 blocks before mined coins can be spent
- **No Pre-mine**: Fair launch with no founder allocation

## Data Flow

### Transaction Processing
1. **Transaction Creation**: User creates transaction via wallet/CLI
2. **Validation**: Transaction validated against UTXO set and network rules
3. **Broadcasting**: Transaction propagated through P2P network
4. **Mining**: Miners include transaction in block candidates
5. **Confirmation**: Block mined and added to blockchain, transaction confirmed

### Block Mining Flow
1. **Block Template**: Miner creates block with pending transactions
2. **RandomX Hashing**: CPU-intensive proof-of-work computation
3. **Difficulty Check**: Solution verified against current network difficulty
4. **Block Broadcast**: Valid block propagated to network peers
5. **Chain Extension**: Network consensus accepts block, extending main chain

### Wallet Operations
1. **Key Generation**: BIP39 mnemonic → seed → HD wallet tree
2. **Address Generation**: Derive addresses from wallet using standard paths
3. **Balance Calculation**: Query UTXO set for wallet's unspent outputs
4. **Transaction Signing**: Create and sign transactions using private keys
